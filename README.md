## Project Scope

We can do a very nice proof of concept demo using both redfish and the new ESXi rest api.

Apart from provisioning the initial ESXi+vCenter stack with Ansible, we also plan to set on top a SDDC NSX-T Nested Lab, and a VRA service over the top.
Helping to fulfill our best chaos engineering dreams, we joined the only two Ansible teams together for greater throughput

## What we would like to do

### Phase 1
- look up IP address of redfish enabled server from table
- look up redfish credentials from table
- retrieve and output serial number from redfish API to console and back to table as a new column

### Phase 2
- Lookup serial number in table, if found, in table, carry on with phase 2
- Set ESXi hostname (may need vSphere 7 for this, using new REST API)
- Set management IP address, mask and gateway, dns details for ESXi (may need vSphere 7 for this, using new REST API)

> this actually has never been done and both phases can be worked on separately

### Phase 3
- Build a nested SDDC NSX-T lab on top based on other existing project.
- Add a VRA service on top as a final step for a complete VCAP nested study lab.

## What we have already learned so far

### ToDos and Getting Things Done

* Get some online learning and hands-on experience
* Prepare a GitHub repository with the necessary submodules

## Lessons Learned
- Designed a first simulated, and afterwards [emulated RedFish-supported Server environment](https://github.com/code2020ansible/AnsiDOC/tree/master/Redfish-Lookup) with Docker for Phase 1, a requirement for the next Phase of the project (get details and setup new ESXi servers)
- Repurposed an [Ansible VMware SDDC Nested Lab toolkit](https://github.com/code2020ansible/AnsiDOC/tree/master/Ansible-microSDDC-Lab) so we could add another existing VRA module for extended functionality.
- Take some time for some e-learning with courses like [Introduction to Ansible with AWS and CloudFormation](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/courses/lesson/course/7748)
