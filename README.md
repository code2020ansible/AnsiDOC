## Project Scope

We can do a very nice proof of concept demo using both redfish and the new ESXi rest api.

Apart from provisioning the initial ESXi+vCenter stack with Ansible, we also plan to set on top a SDDC NSX-T Nested Lab, and a VRA service over the top.
Helping to fulfill our best chaos engineering dreams, we joined the only two Ansible teams together for greater throughput

## What we would like to do

### Phase 1
- look up IP address of redfish enabled server from table
- look up redfish credentials from table
- retrieve and output serial number from redfish API to console and back to table as a new column

### Phase 2
- Lookup serial number in table, if found, in table, carry on with phase 2
- Set ESXi hostname (may need vSphere 7 for this, using new REST API)
- Set management IP address, mask and gateway, dns details for ESXi (may need vSphere 7 for this, using new REST API)

> this actually has never been done and both phases can be worked on separately

### Phase 3
- Build a nested SDDC NSX-T lab on top based on other existing project.
- Add a VRA service on top as a final step for a complete VCAP nested study lab.
